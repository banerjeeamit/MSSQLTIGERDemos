/*
Observe the type of Spill = Recursion
Occurs when the build input does not fit into available memory, 
resulting in the split of input into multiple partitions that are processed separately.	

If any of these partitions still do not fit into available memory, 
it is split into sub-partitions, which are also processed separately. 
This splitting process continues until each partition fits into available memory 
or until the maximum recursion level is reached.
In this case it stopped at level 1.
